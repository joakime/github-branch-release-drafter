Create multiple projects

/github-branch-release-drafter/
  /core/
     The mainline code - java code
     Can produce a uber-jar

     For Github Action workflow.
     When env:GITHUB_EVENT_NAME is present, that indicates an event to process.
     Use env:GITHUB_EVENT_PATH to find exact Event details.

     For Push ...
       Look for "ref": "refs/heads/master",
       That tells us what Draft/Release (target-branch) to update.

       Use head_commit > id to find the commit sha to search TO.
       Find the prior version to search FROM.
       Find all commits in range that also have pull requests.

       Use pull request ids, titles, labels to present changelog in Draft.


  /docker/
     A docker image with the core functionality/jar pushed to hub.docker.com
     This is based on AdoptOpenJDK with the above uber-jar only.
  /webhook-server/
     A server, with Jetty, that can respond to web-hooks from github
     and trigger a release-drafter update.
/action.yml - the main hook for the Github hosted action
/Dockerfile - using the image from hub.docker.com as-is
